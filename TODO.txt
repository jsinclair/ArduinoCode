Check EEPROM dieing problem... talk with Fredi and check here: https://forum.arduino.cc/t/eeprom-questions-on-the-100-000-write-limit/273399/25
Long running millis wrap around problem.

DONE - Verify/update EEPROM implementation.
DONE - Add digital out for ANY arduino activity. Used for battery optimization.
DONE - Add new battery limit for lights.
DONE - Update amp calculation, as per meeting notes and spreadsheet, its madness.
DONE - Add digital out thats on before and after motor turns on (same for up and down)
DONE - Pulse Count/potential other implementation for determining open/close state
DONE - De-bounce on manual switch for lights + open/close
No longer implementing - Implement sleep mode - More research/queries needed

DONE - Remove close position calculation based on current sensor
DONE - Remove reversing of motor for n seconds after reaching closed position
DONE - Remove all USB charger related functions
DONE - Remove all day/night related functions

DONE - Try to setup emulator -> https://www.tinkercad.com/things/ac5A7USTn03-umbrella/editel
